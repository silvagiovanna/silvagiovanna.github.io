        <p class="standart">Hello! <br>I'm Giovanna. 16 years and aries is my sign in case you need to know (sorry for that). I'm christian, and that's an important thing in my life, once its principles -- as love, faith, heaven's life and etc. -- are  my whole life guidings. I go to church twice in a week. <br>
        Besides that, I love learn new thing. Looooo-o-o-ve. This vacation, I've learned the main theme of my next post: programming. No spoilers! <a href="#TBBTT">(click here to see)</a> <br> 
        Well, I think that a list could serve us very well.
        <ul> 
            <li><strong>Blogging:</strong> since 2010, I've made a thousand blogs and I've learned s much! Styling, writing, how to put images and fix errors inside the code. That was the zero step.</li>
            <li><strong>English:</strong> classic. I would watch videos and search every meaning. Today, I have a quilometrical personal dictionary.</li>
            <li><strong>French</strong>: I've choosed to love you! Around 2017, I started to learn french in Duolingo. That helped me build my how-to-learn system, so I have already a base to progress in any language. A thousand apps and "French Weeks" until comprehend fully what Cyprien (<em>youtubeur</em>) and Louane (<em>chanteuse</em>) say. </li>
            <li><strong>Knitting:</strong> I've started this year and it's amazing! In the first tries, there was only a few knots and a lot of chaotic wool. Today, I've already made ecobags, scarfs and doll's clothes (my little sister loves them).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This show have been my whole entertainment since 2019. I discovered this and loved it! It's so intelligent and stupid at the same time, giving <em>that</em> momento to sit, relax and laugh. <br>
            As that important dictate says, "<strong>haters are gonna hate!"</strong>, and there's nothing we can do about it. A lot of people say this show is trash and obnoxious but I see only <strong>FUN AND OK.</strong> Why everything got to be problematic? <br> As Detox says (with all wisdom in the world), <em>I've had it!</em> So, shut up everybody and let me enjoy this amazing TV-show. <br> You all should watch, really.<br> Anyway, I'm gonna spend some time with my people: <strong id="TBBTT">Howard, Leonard, Raj, and Sheldon.</strong><br>See you!
